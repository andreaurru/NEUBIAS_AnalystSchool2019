### API-beating: ImgLib2, ImageJ2 and Big-Data Viewer

Robert Haase (@haesleinhuepf)

After an introduction to ImageJ, Fiji and the ImageJ2 application programming interface (API) the session will be mainly live coding as a 
group. We will construct a workflow by utilizing auto-completion capabilities of IntellIJ and compile the workflow as
ImageJ/Fiji plugin. The workflow will be utilized to convert images between ImageJ1 and ImageJ2 worlds. We will apply a 
threshold and post-process the binary image using ImageJ-Ops. We will visualise intermediate results using BigDataViewer.
Last but not least an overview on upcoming technologies will be given including 
ImageJ-Server, ImageJ Juypter notebooks, ImageJ on GPU (CLIJ) and ImageJ from Python.

**Homework:** To prepare this session, students are asked to install some software packages on their laptops in advance of 
the course:

- IntellIJ https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
- Oracle Java SE Development kit 8 (JDK8) https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
- Fiji https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads
- Last but not least, please download this github repository and open the pom.xml as a project in IntellIJ to check if everything was installed properly: https://github.com/imagej/example-imagej-command

If a student is experienced with Eclipse and wants to use it instead of IntellIJ, he or she is very welcome to do so. 
However, demonstrations, short-cuts and best practices will be presented in IntellIJ.

In case of any issues, please contact Robert: rhaase@mpi-cbg.de

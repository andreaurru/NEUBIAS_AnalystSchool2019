# Deep-Learning techniques for segmentation of Life-Sciences images.

David Rousseau and Pejman Rasti (Universit√© d'Angers, France)

In this advanced course you will learn the basics of convolutional neural
network with illustration of success in bioimage analysis. Limitation and 
bottlenecks in the use of these advanced machine learning tools will be also
highlighted. The conceptual part will be completed with a hands on session
where you will test deep learning methods for image classification and image
segmentation both illustrated on microscopy problems. The examples will be
provided under codes in Keras (tensorflow) that will run under a remotely accessible
environment that the participants will be able to use during and after the
training.

# Requirements

Just a google account with maximum 1 Gbyte free space is requested from
all participants.
